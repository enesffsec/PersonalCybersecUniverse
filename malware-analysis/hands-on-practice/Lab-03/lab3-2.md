## Lab 3-2 Lab03-02.dll

#### 1. How can you get this malware to install itself?

When I checked strings of the `Lab03-02.dll` relaize that import itself.


Imports:

Exports:

![alt text](img/3-2/L3-2-Q1-2.png)

Some suspicious imported functions:
- CreateServiceA
- RegSetValueExA
- HttpOpenRequestA
- HttpSendRequestA


According to this imported function malware might try to:
- Create a specific service to suspicious operations.
- Windows Registry change.
- Http request.

I tried to focus on these 3 types of operations and tried to find some indicators.

I cannot run this .dll for the dynamic analysis with this command
`rundll.exe Lab03-02.dll`

I need to specify function to run dll from export function.
`rundll.exe Lab03-02.dll,installA`

I did not observe any indicators such as Http event or any related registry change on my Windows10 machine. So, I need to install Windows XP for this dll malware analysis.
