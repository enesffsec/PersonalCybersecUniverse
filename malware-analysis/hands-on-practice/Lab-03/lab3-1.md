According to answer of this lab malware should beacon over port 443 with WriteFile. But I cannot establish file write event while dynamic analaysis.

I can create ApateDNS on Windows machine and running inetsim on remnux machine.
Try to capture packet while running malware.
I can observe some TCP packets over port 443

Also according to answer malware create mutex and registry edit events. But i cannot observe that on ProcessExplorer because when malware executed automatically terminated after a while. I check some writeups of this lab and this issue might couse by Windows OS version. My malware analysis lab Windows10 and labs mostly writed for Windows7 and XP.
