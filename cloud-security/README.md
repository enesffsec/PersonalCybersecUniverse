# Cloud Secirity

### Understand Cloud Computing Concepts
- Cloud computing definitions
- Roles and responsibilities (e.g., cloud service customer, provider, partner, broker, regulator)
- Key characteristics (e.g., on-demand self-service, broad network access, multi-tenancy, rapid elasticity, scalability, resource pooling, measured service)
- Building block technologies (e.g., virtualization, storage, networking, databases, orchestration)

### Describe Cloud Reference Architecture
- Cloud computing activities
- Service capabilities (e.g., application, platform, infrastructure)
- Service categories (e.g., Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS))
- Deployment models (e.g., public, private, hybrid, community, multi-cloud)
- Shared considerations (e.g., interoperability, portability, reversibility, availability, security, privacy, resiliency, performance, governance, maintenance, versioning, service levels and agreements (SLA), auditability, regulatory, outsourcing)
- Impact of related technologies (e.g., data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), containers, quantum computing, edge computing, confidential computing, DevSecOps)

### Understand Security Concepts Relevant to Cloud Computing
- Cryptography and key management
- Identity and access control (e.g., user access, privilege access, service access)
- Data and media sanitization (e.g., overwriting, cryptographic erase)
- Network security (e.g., network security groups, traffic inspection, geofencing, zero trust network)
- Virtualization security (e.g., hypervisor security, container security, ephemeral computing, serverless technology)
- Common threats
- Security hygiene (e.g., patching, baselining)

### Understand Design Principles of Secure Cloud Computing
- Secure data lifecycle
- Cloud-based business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) plan
- Business impact analysis (BIA) (e.g., cost-benefit analysis, return on investment (ROI))
- Functional security requirements (e.g., portability, interoperability, vendor lock-in)
- Security considerations and responsibilities for different cloud categories (e.g., Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS))
- Cloud design patterns (e.g., SANS security principles, Well-Architected Framework, Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Enterprise Architecture)
- DevOps security

### Evaluate Cloud Service Providers
- Verification against criteria (e.g., International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27017, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS))
- System/subsystem product certifications (e.g., Common Criteria (CC), Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2)
